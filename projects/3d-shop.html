Autism Resources Hub aims to solve this problem by centralizing existing information into a community managed repository.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <div class="process">
                <p>Most contemporary 3D web research focuses on how 3D graphics can be best applied to specific use-cases. Although it is important to explore these different use-cases, it is also important to know whether a 3D implementation is actually better than a 2D counterpart. Developers would benefit from knowledge of best practices when creating 3D experiences and if users prefer some experiences to remain 2D.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Proposal</h2>
            <div class="process">
                <p>To explore this topic, I plan to create two nearly identical web pages with the difference that one will replace a key 2D element with a 3D implementation. Specifically, these pages will be designed to emulate a product page on an online store. Instead of featuring a standalone item description and a set of images showing various angles and views of the product, the 3D version of the page will feature a 3D model that users can interact with. On the 3D-version page, available user interactions with the model will include: rotating, dragging, zooming, measuring, changing colors, and viewing annotated descriptions of product features. The goal will be to determine whether the 2D or 3D implementation is better for users overall, and what specific interaction elements were good or bad. The data will be collected with a System Usability Scale via an online survey.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
            <div class="process">
                <p>Based on the works I reviewed, there are several preexisting research and development efforts focusing on some combination of 2D and 3D functionality on the web [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Some of these works also make use of Three.js [1, 5, 6]; the WebGL-based JavaScript library I plan to use for my project's development. The implementations described above mainly focus on either medical use-cases [2, 3, 5], or developing a 2D-3D hybrid application [1, 2, 4, 5]. Instead of studying how 2D and 3D elements can be combined, my work will mostly focus on the comparison between how users interact with 2D versus 3D web elements, most similar in nature to Patterson's study [3]. Moreover, none of the research detailed above targets e-commerce applications, or user sentiment regarding specific 3D interaction mechanisms of singular product models; both of which will be focal points of my study. As such, these will be the main contributions of my research and development efforts.</p>

        <h2>Prototype Development</h2>
        <div class="process">
            <div class="square">
                <p>The prototype for 3D shop was predominantly built as a copy of an amazon product page with added 3D model interaction capabilities. This concept realized using developed in Visual Studio Code using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The 3D model and its related interaction features are enabled by importing a JavaScript package called model-viewer which simplifies the complex JavaScript required to create a scene within an HTML Canvas element, render a model in that scene, and control aspects of the scene's environment. Elements of 3D-Shop's 3D interaction such as the annotations and dimensions were created by using pre-packaged model-viewer features in combination with custom JavaScript, whereas the color-selection options were created using only simple JavaScript without referencing any model-viewer terms.</p>

            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p>After developing the prototype to the point that it was working smoothly, I gathered a group of participants for user testing. This group was assembled such that it was roughly representative of internet users as a whole. On a Likert scale between one (not proficient) and five (expert), the average internet proficiency was 3.69. Reponses regarding online shopping frequency were almost completely divided evenly between 'Weekly' (14 participant) and 'Monthly' (14 participants), and the one remaining individual entered the answer of 'Yearly'. Data regarding participant age (Figure 1) was collected by asking participants to identify as one of the following categories: 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, or 65+. All age groups between 25 years old and 64 years old (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64) included between five and seven participants.</p>
            
            <p>Based off the results, 3D Shop appears to be marginally less useful than Amazon, but also, slightly easier to use. The results suggest that the biggest difference between the two sites involved user engagement, in which 3D Shop scored about 15% higher engagement than Amazon. This was the biggest difference between the two in any of the comparison metrics collected. It is possible that there were factors that prevented 3D Shop from scoring as well as it could have. For example, 3D Shop was designed and built by only one person over about a month, with a budget of zero whereas Amazon likely differs in those regards greatly.
            While participants' responses seemed to indicate that online shopping was a great application of 3D interaction on the web, they also suggested some other areas that might be work looking into during future works. After shopping, the second most popular category was education, third was architecture/real estate, fourth was assembly instructions/manuals, and fifth was guided tourism (e.g. interactive museum tours, 3D geographic points of interest maps). Another area to explore in future works involves other interfacing methods than what this study explores. Since this study focused on just laptops and desktops, a major area left unexplored is smaller devices like tablets and smartphones. Given that these types of devices have become ubiquitous (especially smartphones) this is certainly work further research.</p>
