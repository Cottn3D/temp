            <p>3D Shop is my capstone project, representing the culmiation of my Human Computer Interaction studies at RIT. This online store page was built to imitate an Amazon product page, but also allows users to interact with a featured product in 3D for a more engaging and streamlined experience. This project was heavily rooted in research and development, ultimately concluding with an academic study in which participants tested the prototype and submitted evaluations.</p>

            <p>The web currently has tons of resources relating to autism, but it can be difficult to know where to look. Autism Resources Hub aims to solve this problem by centralizing existing information into a community managed repository. Check out my group's process during the development of Autism Resources Hub by clicking one of the buttons below, or keep scrolling to see the final high fidelity prototype.</p>
